<ul></ul>

 <u><h4 id="Days"> Day 1; </h4></u>

 <div class="flexy">
    <p>
The first day, I made my sketches so that I can visualize my physical build. Afterward, I started to wire and code the technical part for my project on Tinkercad, connection potentiometers, buttons, leds, and my servomotor.

<u><h4 id="Days"> Day 2; </h4></u>

<div class="flexy">

<p>This day, I started to wire in person, connecting my servomotor, inserting my mirror and my RGB lights. Afterward, I set up the potentiometer so that the servo-motor could move aswell. Then, I made my base and glued it down. 
   <p></p>

<u><h4 id="Days"> Day 3; </h4></u>

<div class="flexy">
<p>The next day, I made the platform for the projector, connected wheels, and screwed it to the servomotor. I tested it out and the servomotor started to move back and forth.

<u><h4 id="Days"> Day 4; </h4></u>

<div class="flexy">
    
<p>The RGB lights couldn't work becuase the squiggly pins that RGB's required were broken. So I looked back at the logo for Batman and decided to make the background yellow, using yellow LED'S.

<u><h4 id="Days"> Day 5; </h4></u>

<div class="flexy">
    
<p>I painted the projector black so that the lights would shine brighter, and my 3d silhouette for the outline got printed. After the projector finished drying, I added the led lights inside and aligned them to the mirror. </p>

</div>

<u><h4 id="Days"> Day 6; </h4></u>
<div class="flexy">
    
<p>I painted the base white, and glued the 3d printed item to my projector. I also glued down the projector under the servo-motor, and made a slot so I could wire the lights from the inside. Lastly, I measured the length and widths, so that I could make an accurate isometric drawing.  </p> 
   <p></p>

<u><h4 id="Days"> Day 7; </h4></u>
<div class="flexy">
    
<p>Lastly, I did a few final test runs, realigning the servomotor so that it turns 180. I taped down the breadboard and arduino, securing the wire in the process. Lastly, I turned off the lights and tested it out, once and for all. (I didn't show the darker video because it did not show. )  </p>

<u><h4 id="Days"> Day 8; </h4></u>
<div class="flexy">
    
<p>Since I finished everything, I took the measurements from my sketches and made my isometric and orthographic drawings. </p>

<u><h4 id="Days"> What would I have done different?;</h4></u>

<p>If I had more time, I would change alot of things; but if I had to choose a few things,
    <div class="flexy">
    <li>1. I'd probably want to weld the wires together, so that they don't come out so easily. </li>
<li>2.  Extra bright led lights, so that when they reflect off the mirror in my projector, it has a brighter and stronger background.</li>
<li>3. I'd want a neater base so that my wire and breadboard can hide, having a more neat appearance. </li>
